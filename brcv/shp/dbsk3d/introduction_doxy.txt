/*! \mainpage dbsk3d : Brown Shock3D Library
* This library contains data structures and algorithms to compute 
* three-dimensional shocks.
*
* \section dbsk3d_overview Overview
*
* The dbsk3d_fullshock class is responsible for maintaining a hypergraph of 
* dbsk3d_ShockElement elements. These elements can be points (dbsk3d_NodeElement),
* line segments (dbsk3d_LinkElement) and sheet elements (dbsk3d_PatchElement).
*
* The dbsk3d_scaffold_hypergraph class is responsible for maintaining a hypergraph
* on top of dbsk3d_fullshock, which is also a hypergraph of 
* scaffold_element elements: scaffold_vertex, scaffold_curve, scaffold_sheet,
* and loop case of scaffold_loop_vertex, scaffold_loop_curve.
