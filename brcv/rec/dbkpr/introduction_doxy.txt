/*! \mainpage dbkpr : keypoint recognition library
* Routines to match and reconstruct keypoints
*
* \section Overview
* The process in the 'pro' directory enables one to run all the facilities in
* brown eyes. You can: detect keypoints, match them, and reconstruct cameras and
* 3D points:
*   - dbkpr_bbf_match_process : matches two views based on SIFT descriptors
*   - dbkpr_span_match_process : matches whole video sequence using SIFT descriptors and estimates fundamental matrices
*   - dbkpr_reconstruct_process : structure and motion recovery by bundle adjustment
*
* \sa dbdet
*
* \section Details of classes
*
* \subsection After Global Match Process (dbkpr_span_match_process)
* Each frame will store:
*   - dbdet_keypoint_storage : matched keypoints
*   - dbkpr_corr3d_storage :
*     - default initial camera (hand-initialized, equal for all frames)
*     - Global correspondence
*       - YES, the same one is currently being copied on every single frame
