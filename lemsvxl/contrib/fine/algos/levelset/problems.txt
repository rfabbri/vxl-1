this algorithm uses the boost library for it's implementation of an image

I attempted to alter the code so that it used vil_image_view instead but it appears to be too deeply embedded in the algorithm

Currently the files in the directory are altered in an unsuccesful attempt at making it build

The files in the archive are the original files
