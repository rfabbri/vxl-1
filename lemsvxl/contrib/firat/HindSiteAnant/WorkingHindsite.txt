Step 1: Get the params.xml file in order
		Set the paths to the fragments right, the folders and 	stuff ready. Keep an output/111/user folder ready if the code 	does not do 
		so.(It does not while I am writing this but I hope to incorporate it soon.)
Step 2: Run the program as Executeable_name.exe -x params.xml 
Step 3: The Program first reads the parameters from the get_params function by creating an xml parser
Step 4: Then it gets status of the job using "get_status" i.e. it finds out if pairmatching has been already done for this set of data and
		how many iterations(if any) have already been run.
Step 5: Next is the actual pairwise matching. First step to this is to get the images and conoturs which is done by a function of hte same name.
		It creates a pointer to a new fragment and stores its top image, bottom image, top contour and bottom contour alogn with it. Kind of 
		a fragment data structure. Once this is done, local vectors of curves are made which store the top and bottom contours linked with each
		fragment. Then a new puzzle solving is created with these local vectors. These are then pre-processed .(This ensures that original frag
		objects still have the orignial contours and they dont get changed). Then a new search state called pair_match is created by running the
		pair match method. This runs DPMatch on all curves. Now this has a few operations i feel are redundant like updating both _Contours and
		_cLists. But I really couldn't figure out if that was useful or not. So a search state is created for frag pairs with a matches list which
		basically has indices to corresponding matches in the global matches list. Then this is written out.
