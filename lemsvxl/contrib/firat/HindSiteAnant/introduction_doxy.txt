*
* \section dbpz_hindsite_overview Overview
*
* HindSite (codenamed bfrag) was created in the BrownEyes directory and framework.  
* It is compiled with the following directive in breye\CMakeLists.txt
* 
* #HindSite
* SUBDIRS( bfrag )
* 
* 
* This is not the best way to do things, and it was never added to the CVS repository
* as it would often burn the tree.  As such it appears under projects\kimia\HindSite
* but requires some work (simple if you know MSVC, i assume) to compile on its own.
