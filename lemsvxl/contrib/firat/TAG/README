This folder contains the matlab codes I've written for the Topological Appearance Graph Project.
Please read the technical report I wrote to understand the algorithm. Then, look at the code.

TAG_detector_v1 and min_saddle_candidate_detector are capable of producing a TAG for the given image. However, it is not perfect and contains non-planar subgraphs which should not happen.
TAG_detector_v2 and min_watershed_detector correspond to the algorithm explained in the report. However, it is not complete, so it cannot generate a TAG. See the TODOs in TAG_detector_v2.m 

lemsvxl/src/contrib/firat/matlab/levelset_watershed -> This folder contains the codes I wrote for the project. It is pretty unorganized.
lemsvxl/src/contrib/firat/matlab/levelset_watershed/experiments -> This folder contains the codes I wrote for the experiments. 
/lemsvxl/src/contrib/firat/TAG/report -> The latest copy of the report
