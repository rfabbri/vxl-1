/*! \mainpage mw: Ric's Sandbox for Multiview algorithms
*
* This library contains experimental research code by Ricardo Fabbri.
*
* More mature parts are routinely migrated to: 
*   - bdifd: multiview differential geometry lib
*   - vpgld: traditional photogrammetry/MVG algorithms,
*   - becld: Epipolar curve library
*   - dbkpr: key point recognition, matching & reconstruction
*
* \todo rename algo/mw_match_position_band and mw_match_tangent_band to a common
* naming scheme
*
*
* \todo Thoughts on cleaning up / breaking up code into sub-libs.
*
*   
*  Multiview curve frag lib
*   
*   - becld_intersection_sets
*     todo: try to find my notes about the motivations behind it
*   
*   Multiview Edgel lib
*   
*   Pointset Multiview matching lib - dbkpr_algo?
*   - mw_match_position_band 
*   - mw_match_tangent_band ?
*   
*   bdifd
*   
*   becld
*   
*   vpgld_algo
*      merge vpgld_load_camera_process_h with dan's formats
*   
*   brct
*   
*   Geometric photogrammetry lib (a geometric version of vpgld)
*   - algo/mw_qualitative_epipolar
*   
*   Don't know where it goes:
*   - load_con_file (from bmcsd_util.h) 
*   - pro/vidpro_save_vsol_process
*   - pro/dbdet_combine_curves_process
*
