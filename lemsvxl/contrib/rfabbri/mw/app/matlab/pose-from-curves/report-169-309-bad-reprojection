High reprojection error for synthetic data

169-309


In this case all returned rotations give high reprojection error.
The one giving lowest reprojection error has low reprojection error for samples
169-309, but high for all the other ones.

It seems that the method simply failed to find the right rotation.

Looking into the plot, there seems to be one point which should be a root but
wasn't found. Indeed, the polynomial doesn't cross zero there but nearly touches
the x axis.

TODO
  - I'll artificially insert this root into the system to see if I can get the
    right rotation
