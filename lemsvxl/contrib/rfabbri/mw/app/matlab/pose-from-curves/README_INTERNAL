Main files to generate result plots
  ./a.sh : p2pt exps in parallel
  ./b.sh : p3p exps in parallel
    From these main files one can infer
    P3P matlab function call calls this script
    /Users/rfabbri/cprg/vxlprg/lemsvpe/lemsvxl/contrib/rfabbri/mw/scripts/pnp-run-vm
    That calls this C++
        /Users/rfabbri/cprg/vxlprg/lemsvpe/lemsvxl/contrib/rfabbri/mw/cmd/pnp
          to build this, one needs USE_OpenMVG ON in lems
          to build OpenMVG, follow the opnemvg/BUILD.md **closely**, see: 
          
    
    
    
  


To generate the plots in the original ECCV12 paper;
