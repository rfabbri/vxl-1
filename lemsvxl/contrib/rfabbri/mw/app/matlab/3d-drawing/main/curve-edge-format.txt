./curve-edge/file.txt  --> we don't know what the file name looks like, it should be named 
                       --> eg midday-640x-0017.txt for midday-640x-0017.png
viewName = name of file without .txt  --> thus should be 1 of these .txt file per view
The edge files are named 
./edges/file.edg  --> question: is this the same .edg files in the datasets or ./edges
./curves/file.cemv  --> is this the same cemv as in the datasets or a special folder?

numEdge: number of edges in original .edg
numContours: number of curves

# file.txt FILE FORMAT: -------------------------------------------

# --- start [Curve i]
[numCurEdges]  --> suppose is the number of edges in curve i
[edge id 1] [edge id 2] .... [edge id numCurEdges]


# --- start [Curve numContours]
...

# ----------------------------------------------------------------

Just construct:

curveIndices{view id}(edge id) == curve number having this id
curveOffsets{view id}(edge id) == index of edge within its curve - 1 

NOTE: edge_ids are the same sas in the files, but +1 since matlab indexing starts at 1
curve number also starts at 1
curve offset indices start at 0

Write them out to:
edge-curve-index_yuliang_pavilion-mixed.mat : curveIndices
edge-curve-offset_yuliang_pavilion-mixed.mat : curveOffsets

BUT (no code found): 
Some other code expects other .txt files for this information, not .mat
