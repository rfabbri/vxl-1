curve_drawing_main.m is average_curves_final_12 modularized or broken into different files

I'm making a summary to run the 3D curve drawing system. This text will be
pasted into /home/biao/cprg/vxlprg/lemsvpe/doc/3d-curve-drawing.md and is being constantly updated.

**first of all go to lemsvpe/README.md to compile and configure the programming environment**

You need to define which dataset to use. Record how many views it has. You will need this.

if in your dataset there are only png or jpg files, you will need to generate
edg files, otherwise, move on to the next stage.
For this, go to the terminal in the dataset and compile parallel ::: edge ::: *.png (or *.jpg) 
edg files will be generated by third order detection.

if in your dataset there aren't cemv files, you will need to generate them,
otherwise, move on to the next stage. 
For this, got to the terminal in the dataset and compile
parallel ::: contours ::: --edgesuffix ::: .edg ::: *.png (or *.jpg)
cemv files are generated.

your dataset certainly does not contain curve-edge associations. These files are generated by edg_cemv_to_txt.m. Go to lemsvpe/lemsvxl/contrib/rfabbri/mw/app/matlab/3d-drawing/main and run it. before that, create a folder called edge-curve inside the dataset

go lemsvpe/vxd/contrib/brld/bmvgd/bmcsd/cmd and make a copy of mcs_e for your dataset
go lemsvpe/lemsvxl/contrib/rfabbri/mw/scripts and make a copy of mcs_e_rec and
mcs_e_rec_dataset

if in your dataset there aren't projmatrix files, you will need to generate
them, otherwise, move on the next stage. To do this, type the command -cam_type
projcamera in the mcs_e_rec_dataset options and run ./mcs_e_rec_dataset. This 
will also generate the attributes needed for 3D curve drawing.

Then, follow the steps below

go lemsvpe/lemsvxl/contrib/rfabbri/mw/app/matlab/3d-drawing/main and open matlab

open curve_drawing_main.m and go to the definitions_12.m module. inside it, make changes to the variables numIM and all_views. read the comments.

inside load_pattern_12.m module put the path that accesses the .dat files below before crvs. you can to see this in load_curve_sketch_without_associations.m module and it is called inside this module. 

now go to the load_edge_and_curve_files.m module. there you will need to enter the paths where the cemv, edg, projmatrix, txt and png (or jpg) files are located.

in read_association_attributes_12 you need to put the path where attributes
from mcs_e are located

in computing_associations.m it will be need enter paths the projmatrix files are
located in line 5 and 27

create a folder named ply inside dataset and put the path in
write_curve_graph_to_vrml_12.m module line 90 and 124. in these lines replace the word dataset with some reference to the current dataset


obs:create a folder called export_fig inside the dataset which is called by the read_cons function.
indispensable functions: distinguishable_colors.m, read_cons.m, read_cem_file.m, read_association_attributes_12.m, load_edg.m, get_length.m, find_closest_point_on_curve.m, write_curve_graph_to_vrml_12.m

if you prefer add the path before run curve_drawing_main
/home/biao/cprg/vxlprg/lemsvpe/lemsvxl/contrib/rfabbri/mw/app/matlab/3d-drawing/original
