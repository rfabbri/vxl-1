# Algorithm 3D curve drawing system

**first of all go to lemsvpe/README.md, read it carefully and configure the programming environment**

## After the dataset has been defined

### Input: sequence of images from the chosen dataset I<sub>j,<sub> (j=1,...,N).

### Output: 3D curve drawing of a scene or an object.

#### Procedures:

##### 1. Turn the images into edgels, contours
 a. If in your dataset there are only png or jpg files, you will need to generate
    edg files, otherwise, move on to 2. For this, go to the terminal in the dataset and compile:
    parallel ::: edge ::: *.png (or *.jpg) 
    Then edg files will be generated by third order detection. To generate edg files one by one: 
    edge filename.png (or jpg)

 b. If in your dataset there aren't cemv files, you will need to generate them, otherwise, move on to 3.
    For this, got to the terminal in the dataset and compile:
    parallel ::: contours ::: --edgesuffix ::: .edg ::: *.png (or *.jpg)
    cemv files are generated. To generate cemv files one by one:
    contours --edgesuffix .edg filename.png (or jpg)

##### 2. Match the edge-curve
  a. Your dataset certainly does not contain edge-curve associations. These files are generated by edg_cemv_to_txt.m. Go to lemsvpe/lemsvxl/contrib/rfabbri/mw/app/matlab/3d-drawing/main and run it. Before that, create a folder called edge-curve inside the dataset.
    Carlos: (TODO) direct the files to be saved in the edge-curve folder

##### 3. Enhanced reconstruction: generate attributes
 a. go lemsvpe/vxd/contrib/brld/bmvgd/bmcsd/cmd and make a copy of mcs_e for your dataset

 b. go lemsvpe/lemsvxl/contrib/rfabbri/mw/scripts and make a copy of mcs_e_rec and mcs_e_rec_dataset

 c. if in your dataset there aren't projmatrix files, you will need to generate
them, otherwise, move on to 4. To do this, type the command -cam_type
projcamera in the mcs_e_rec_dataset options and run mcs_e_rec_dataset: ./mcs_e_rec_dataset. This 
will also generate the attributes needed for 3D curve drawing.

##### 4. go lemsvpe/lemsvxl/contrib/rfabbri/mw/app/matlab/3d-drawing/main and open matlab

##### 5. open curve_drawing_main.m and go to the definitions_12.m module. inside it, make changes to the variables numIM and all_views. read the comments.

##### 6. inside load_pattern_12.m module put the path that accesses the .dat files below before crvs. you can to see this in load_curve_sketch_without_associations.m module and it is called inside this module. 

##### 7. now go to the load_edge_and_curve_files.m module. there you will need to enter the paths where the cemv, edg, projmatrix, txt and png (or jpg) files are located.

##### 8. in read_association_attributes_12 you need to put the path where attributes
from mcs_e are located

##### 9. in computing_associations.m it will be need enter paths the projmatrix files are
located in line 5 and 27

##### 10. create a folder named ply inside dataset and put the path in
write_curve_graph_to_vrml_12.m module line 90 and 124. in these lines replace the word dataset with some reference to the current dataset


obs:create a folder called export_fig inside the dataset which is called by the read_cons function.
indispensable functions: distinguishable_colors.m, read_cons.m, read_cem_file.m, read_association_attributes_12.m, load_edg.m, get_length.m, find_closest_point_on_curve.m, write_curve_graph_to_vrml_12.m

if you prefer add the path before run curve_drawing_main
/home/biao/cprg/vxlprg/lemsvpe/lemsvxl/contrib/rfabbri/mw/app/matlab/3d-drawing/original

curve_drawing_main.m is average_curves_final_12 modularized or broken into different files

algorithm to run the 3D curve drawing system. This text will be
pasted into /home/biao/cprg/vxlprg/lemsvpe/doc/3d-curve-drawing.md and is being constantly updated.
