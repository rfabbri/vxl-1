# Usecase 0: same machine, just set work folder. This is what I use in CCV

# Usecase 1: this script is called by matlab, and this script calls a binary
#
# This is usually called by matlab on a virtual machine,
# to run pnp on the native host, so that accurate timings are obtained
# without polluting the native host with matlab malware outside the vm
#
# The working folder is on the VM and is mounted on the native host.
