==================================

The calibration code uses Levenberg marquardt iterative minimization technique to match the images in the given dataset with the images generated by projecting the 3-D artifact model into the sensor plane using certain parameters (which are determined optimally at the end of the calibration process)

All the information (e.g the paramaters required for fitting the conics to images) are mentioned in a text file which is provided as input to the code..

The sequence of steps for doing the calibration is as follows:

1.cali_conics_write_bin.cxx takes the images from the dataset and fits conics to these images based on the parameters mentioned in the input text file.These conics are stored in a folder called "bins" which has to be in the same directory as the image dataset

2.cali_calibrate.cxx does the optimization part and writes out the scan file with the optimized values 


A sample input text file "parameters.txt " has also been committed to the repository.The description of the various entries in the text file has been provided in cali_param.h


For the calibration process,the user can freeze the parameters of his choice or there is another option called the two stage calibration process where a certain fixed number of parameters are varied in stage 1 followed by varying all the parameters in stage 2.


==================================
A note about the turn table parameters:

according to the definition of the biotree standard coordinates (refer to BioTreeStandardCoordinates.ppt under the doc directory in biotree ),there is 90 degrees rotation about x-axis and a translation along z-direction between the turn table coordinate system and the camera coordinate system. This leads to keeping the parameters corresponding to the turn table rotation quaternion constant (90 degrees ) and also the turn table translation along y direction is to be frozen as 0.

there can a translation in the x direction and this effect is infact noticeable as 'postalignment' parameter in the Nrecon software provided by the skyscan systems.
The x component of the principal point varies to partially compensate for this effect


To sum up,it has been found to be useful to freeze the parameters corresponding to the turn table rotation (90 degrees rotation about x axis) as well as the y component of the turn table translation (0) and also the x-component of the principal point (which is taken as half the dimension of the image along x direction )
