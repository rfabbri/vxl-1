* This library provides a set of base classes for process, storage, and parameters object.
*
* \section bpro_overview Overview
*
* The bpro_storage class is an abstract base class for 
* derived storage classes that may store any type of data.  The bpro_process class
* is an abstract base class for derived process classes that execute various algorithms
* Thus, a bpro_storage class is a wrapper around your data structures while a
* bpro_process is a wrapper around your algorithm.  Additional parameters to a
* process are managed by the bpro_parameters class.
