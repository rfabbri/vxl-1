# 3D Curve Sketch and Drawing System


## Hacking / Compiling / Building

- Read the [README](../README.md) for LEMSVPE carefully. It explains the setup,
and also lists a website for VXL-related compilation specific for our project
from Ricardo Fabbri (http://wiki.nosdigitais.teia.org.br/VXL)

## Code location

`vxd/contrib/brld/bmvgd/bmcsd/cmd`

Read vxd/contrib/brld/bmvgd/bmcsd/README.md
Update that bmcsd/README.md with public info, leave most private info to this file.

## Datasets
The input datasets where we are doing 3D rec for the 3D Curve Drawings CVPR'10 paper have *-mcs-work suffix.
You can download them at:
- 3D Curve Sketch dataset recovered by Hongyi: 
    - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByTILAQRKQoLMHpmRTBWWlhpTTQ
    - seems to be part of what was used for the 3D curve drawing paper
