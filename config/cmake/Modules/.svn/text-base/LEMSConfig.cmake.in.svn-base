# This CMake module is configured by LEMS VXL's build process to export
# the project settings for use by client projects.  A client project may
# find LEMS and include this module using the FIND_PACKAGE command:
#
#  FIND_PACKAGE(LEMS)
#
# After this command executes, projects may test LEMS_FOUND for whether
# LEMS has been found.  If so, the settings listed below in this file
# have been loaded and are available for use.

# when building.  The stanzas below give a consistent (though
# pedantic) interface to each part.  Clients use these settings to
# determine whether a part was built (_FOUND), where its headers are
# located (_INCLUDE_DIR) and in some cases what libraries must be
# linked to use the part (_LIBRARIES).  Most client projects will
# likely still refer to vcl by hard-wired "vcl" instead of using the
# variable VXL_VCL_LIBRARIES, but it is there just in case.
