This file holds the lemsvxl code for the pb edge detector. The edge detector
is still not working in regards to orientation and subpixel location. Once
this is working it will be moved to dbdet/pro and dbdet/algo respecitively.
To use these files place them in dbdet/pro and dbdet/algo and change
the respecitive CMakelists.txt file to account for this.
