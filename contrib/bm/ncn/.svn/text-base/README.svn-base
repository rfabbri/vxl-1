 This project is to investigate methods for avoiding false detection of shadow in change
 detection algorithms.
 The main methods will involve a non compact markov neighborhood placed at each pixel.
 A neighborhood around each pixel will be a set of pivot pixels.
 Pivot Pixels are chosen stochastically by examining areas of the image sequence which have high entropy
 by using importance sampling techniques.
