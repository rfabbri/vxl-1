% Get trinocular real data:
% - get 3 views of real data with calibration.
%     - Pick a dataset
%     - Load into gui for edgel tracing
%     - Pick two point-tangent pairs in views (0,1)
%            - transversal is better.
%     - Print point, tangent for each view, double precision
%     - Reconstruct the point tangent and print the 3D point tangent.
%     - Pick point-tangent in 3rd view by hand, print.
% - measure reprojection error with dataset cameras
% - now solve for 3rd camera from first 2 
%  - compare reprojection error
