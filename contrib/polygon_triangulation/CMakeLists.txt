# A Polygon triangulation code from flipcode.com

#
# THIS IS A CODE SNIPPET WHICH WILL EFFICIEINTLY TRIANGULATE ANY
# POLYGON/CONTOUR (without holes) AS A  CLASS.  THIS SNIPPET
# IS COMPRISED OF 3 FILES, TRIANGULATE.H, THE HEADER FILE FOR THE
# TRIANGULATE BASE CLASS, TRIANGULATE.CPP, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
# THE TRIANGULATE BASE CLASS, AND TEST.CPP, A SMALL TEST PROGRAM
# DEMONSTRATING THE USAGE OF THE TRIANGULATOR.  THE TRIANGULATE
# BASE CLASS ALSO PROVIDES TWO USEFUL HELPER METHODS, ONE WHICH
# COMPUTES THE AREA OF A POLYGON, AND ANOTHER WHICH DOES AN EFFICENT
# POINT IN A TRIANGLE TEST.
