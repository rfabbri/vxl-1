This Folder contains the various Codes contained herein.

1)XXXXXXReconstructionCP - These are codes to reconstruct the specific image from the various critical points
2)DataSetMatchingXXXX - Code to match query images and database images using either of the three methods SIFT, max or min
3)FirstDerivativeXXXX - Code to calculate the first derivative of the given image or function using concept of finite differences.
4)SecondDerivativeXXXX - Code to calculate the second derivative of given image or function using the concept of finite differences.
5)SIFTMatchingXXXX - Code to simply match two images and display the matched descriptors. Matching criteria can be either SIFT, max or min.
6)PlotCriticalPoints - Code to display the critical points on the image colormap to get a visual representation.
7)SmoothingvsCriticalpoints - Code to plot the number of the critical points in an images vs the value of sigma (in gaussian filter) used to smoothen the image.
8)GaussianFilterDifference - Code to plot the difference between successive gaussian filter of increasing sigma value.
9)ZeroCrossingDetector - Code the detect the zero crossing of a function.
