[[Image:Ubuntu-logox45.png|right]]This is a checklist and a set of tips on setting up a complete ubuntu installation suitable for software development and scientific research.  

These instructions were tested on Ubuntu 16.10 but are almost the same for 12.04, 11.10, down to 11.04.

==Partitioning for Programming==

For programming, I use the following partition guidelines
* <tt>/</tt> : from 20 to 100GB (usually a full-fledged Ubuntu install for multimedia development will consume 16GB, from my experience)
* <tt>/linux2</tt> : I place another Linux partition here, so that I can have 2 linux distros. The size is the same guidelines as I mentioned above for '/'.
* <tt>/home</tt> : your files that are visible to all linux distros and remain untouched between reinstalls.
* Swap: if you do heavy simulations, double your RAM is a good rule of thumb here; otherwise, you'll do fine with just a couple GB here.

File system: choose ext4, it performs very well on most circumstances.

In the case of a laptop with a small internal SSD and a large slow HD, I've successfully used the following sheme
* <tt>/</tt>: goes into the SSD, minus /var
* <tt>/var</tt>: goes into the slow HD. 20GB should be more than enough here.

In the case of most modern UEFI firmware (replacing BIOS), you need to make sure there's an EFI partition.


== Installing Packages and Configurations ==

Be resourceful. Install most of the stuff you'll ever need so you don't have to worry about it later. After this, your system will consume about 15GB total

# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This script was based on the instructions from
#     http://wiki.nosdigitais.teia.org.br/Configuring_Ubuntu_for_Programming
#
# USAGE
#   
#   sudo sh configure-ubuntu-for-programming
#
# TODO
#
#   Scheme to download all packages into one computer and reuse them for the
#   remaining computers of a large Lab, in order to save time and bandwidth.

# if you get any error, remove the package one by one.

apt-get -y build-dep blender evince okular mplayer mpv gimp libreoffice empathy kino vlc gxine puredata lmms inkscape

# if you get any error, remove the package one by one.
# Even if you get a "but it is not going to be installed" message, remove the
# package from the above line. For Ubuntu 15.10, I removed scilab and firefox.
# But you can try them anyways
#
#
# Try:
# apt-get -y build-dep scilab
# apt-get -y build-dep firefox
#

# Remove the unified menu
#
apt-get remove indicator-appmenu 

# Diodon clipboard history manager
#
# Newer ubuntu ship this by default
# For older ubuntu, you might have to uncomment the following lines
#sudo add-apt-repository ppa:diodon-team/stable
#sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install diodon
echo Tip: go to diodon preferences and set all options

# Multiload system usage indicator
# Newer ubuntu ship this by default
# For older ubuntu, you might have to uncomment the following lines
#sudo add-apt-repository ppa:indicator-multiload/stable-daily
#sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install indicator-multiload

# Apt-file to search for packages containing a specified file (useful for compiling)
#
# apt-file find example.h will locate package that has it
sudo apt-file update

# install the latest stable git possible
# this is important for certain features, specially for subtrees
# and submodules. Also cool for diff highlighting and other sugar

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade git

# so you can use locate to search for files
sudo updatedb


# enable workspaces, linearly for consistency with Mac OS workflows
gsettings set org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ hsize 4
gsettings set org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ vsize 1


# Tweaks
#  ...... and this is why Linux is much more professional than Mac OS for
#  advanced (truly pro) users
#
# Run:
#   unity-tweak-tool
# And enable auto-hide for the launcher
#
# Enable focus follow mouse. This is excellent for productivity as you can
# copy paste between windows without clicking, without messing up window order- R. Fabbri
# - Go to General -> Additional. Focus mode: Sloppy or Mouse.
# Basically try out sloppy or mouse, see what works with Alt-Tab etc.
#
#
# Tray Icons 
#
#   I regorganize all icons on the unity tray as follows:
#     - 1. browser 2. terminal 3. vim
#
# Firefox tweaks
#   Reduce firefox font and menu sizes
#
#   Reduce UI size for Unity
#
# gnome-tweak-tool
#     Enable Capslock as an additional Ctrl under Typing
#
# dconf-editor
#     org > gtk > settings > file-chooser set Location Mode path-bar
#

#
# Preload the mostly used apps in RAM. Just do:
# sudo apt install preload


# IRC
# Configure your client. I use IRSSI, but if you're a Newbie, use XChat :P
# Add it to startup applications per
# 
# http://wiki.nosdigitais.teia.org.br/IRC


# Apt-rdepends sample usage:
# apt-rdepends --reverse (packagename)

# == Cuda ==
# The following steps makes CUDA (for NVidia cards) work with software such as
# [[Blender]]
# [http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/7485/enabling-gpu-rendering-for-cycles]
# [http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/31045/cuda-rendering-on-linux-mint-or-ubuntu-variants/31111#31111] 

# Install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers.
# Go to System Settings -> Software Updates -> Additional Drivers Tab and select the latest stable.
# Install some cuda-specific packages: 
#
# sudo apt-get install nvidia-modprobe nvidia-cuda-toolkit
</syntaxhighlight>

==Other Configs==

* nvidia-drivers
* wish 8.5 (see listamacambira email) - nice tcl/tk GUI

You might want to change UID to same as the UID of your other computers or external hard drives (same with GID)

 usermod -u UID username
 groupmod -g GID username

This will take care of everything inside /home/username, /etc/passwd and the like. Remember to edit /etc/login.defs if your UID is below 1000

=== Other CUDA Instructions ===
You can try to follow this:

=== Getting back to Ubuntu / Unity (for 13.10 users) ===
The above commands installs kubuntu-full to get programs and libs from ubuntu. But if you want to go back to unity just do this:
* edit the file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf  
* change the line user-session to be
 user-session=ubuntu
* change the line greeter-session to be
 greeter-session=unity-greeter 
== Automation Script ==
The latest instructions on this page are automated inside an install script that is shipped as part of the [[Lab Macambira]] utils Git repository:

http://labmacambira.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=labmacambira/utils;a=blob;f=configure-ubuntu-for-programming;hb=HEAD

You can download it using Git (for easily downloading later updates) like this:


    $ git clone git://labmacambira.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/labmacambira/utils

Or, if you are a [[Lab Macambira]] comitter or if you have a sourceforge user:

    $ git clone ssh://<usuario>@labmacambira.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/labmacambira/utils

The above script is pretty much like achieving a developer's distro on top of a raw ubuntu installation.
